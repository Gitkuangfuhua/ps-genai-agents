    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is based on the `ps-genai-agents` intenral project. `ps-genai-agents` refactors and builds on the work done for the Honda GenAI POC and aims to develop LLM agents that are able to work with a variety of datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "These agents are built using the `LangGraph` library which lets us define workflows within a graph architecture. These workflows may contain a variety of retrieval tools such as vector search and Text2Cypher. We may also implement tools for tasks such as generating charts or domain-specific word look ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/neo4j-field/ps-genai-agents)\n"
